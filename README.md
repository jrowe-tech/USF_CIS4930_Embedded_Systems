# USF_CIS4930_Embedded_Systems
This repository consists of the embedded C and TI-ASM codes produced during the CIS4930 Embedded Systems class at USF. The class is about learning how embedded microcontrollers/microprocessors are utilized, different use-cases, and building complex systems with an embedded TI MSP430FR2355 board using both assembly and C.
